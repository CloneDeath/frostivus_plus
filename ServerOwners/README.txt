This is mostly for my own recreation, in case my PC crashes, but in case you want to host a server, here's what you do:

1) Set up server according to this post (if you are reading a wiki in a post in a post, you are doing it right):
http://www.reddit.com/r/Dota2Modding/comments/1v3ywq/custom_gamemodes_how_to_play_frota_and_set_up/

2) Figure out how to use the included files. Use google, it shouldn't be hard. If you got frota or frostivus working, then these files uses should be obvious.

I'll write up better documentation when things are less dynamic.
